<p>This project represents the second challenge of the Compass.UOL Scholarship Program, and this time, it was undertaken collaboratively as a group effort. The primary objective was to develop 
  a website inspired by the classic social networking platform, Orkut. Our task involved creating a responsive web application with various distinct page routes, 
  enabling users to access different sections seamlessly on various devices. Additionally, we implemented a user registration and login system to enhance the overall user experience.</p>

## List of Features:
- The website allows users to navigate through various pages, enabling them to explore different sections and content.

- Users can create their accounts on the platform, providing essential information such as name, email, and password.
